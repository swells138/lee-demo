      <p>
        Mdl Professional Food Service LLC, doing business as Lee&apos;s Concessions, 
        started with one simple mission — to share delicious, high-quality food 
        with our community while delivering a service experience people remember. 
        Owner <strong>Mike Lee</strong> brings years of hands-on expertise in food 
        service and a personal dedication to friendly, reliable hospitality.

      <p>
        Our team is <strong>ServSafe certified</strong> and committed to 
        upholding the highest standards of food safety. Whether we’re serving 
        fair classics from our iconic red-and-yellow trailer, creating custom 
        menus for weddings and corporate events, or providing professional 
        ServSafe training to local businesses, we approach every project with 
        care and attention to detail.

        Over the years, Lee’s Concessions has become a trusted presence at 
        festivals, fairs, and private gatherings across Ohio. From hand-dipped 
        corn dogs to tenderloin sandwiches and everything in between, we combine 
        the fun of concession food with the professionalism of a full-service 
        catering company.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you need a crowd-pleasing food trailer for your next event, 
        a professional caterer for your special day, or training to keep your 
        team compliant and confident, Lee’s Concessions is here to make it happen.
